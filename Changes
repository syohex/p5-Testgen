  Original source codes are testgen2-20110128.zip.

  [Modification]
     General
       - Object Oriented prgramming
       - Modern Perl programming style as possible
       - CPAN style directory hierarchy
       - Add test programs under t/ directory
       - Remove use of external command, using standard module
         instead of them as possible

       More readable as possible !!

     Template file
       - Fix typo author's name 'Youki Uchiyama' => 'Yuki Uchiyama'
       - Default encoding euc-jp => utf8
       - Introduction of predefined macro (eg. $CHARMAX(), $UCHARMAX()...)
           Original template file depend on 32bit platform, so some tests
           are failed on 64bit platform. You can do away with number literals
           which depend on bit-width of target platform by using predefined
           macros.

           Predefined macros are auto generated from a configuration file.

     Configuration file
       - just a perl hash reference( parsing and analyzing easily!! )

     Run script
       - color log
       - fix log message
       - parallel testing(Experimental)
